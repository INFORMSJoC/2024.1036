# Results

The detailed computational results are available in the file:

**`Detailed results on cluster branching.xlsx`**

Most of the results can be extracted directly from this file: 
- **Tables 4 and 5** of the paper are located in the `XML` sheet. 
- **Table 6** is located in the `X` sheet. 
- **Table 7** is located in the `Homberger` sheet. 

Please note that while the XML sheet provides the basis for Tables 4 and 5, some values may not appear in fully explicit form.

In addition, the folder also contains the file:

**`Companion Material: Cluster Branching for Vehicle Routing Problems.pdf`**

This document corresponds to the supplementary material of the paper in PDF format.
